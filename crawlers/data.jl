A job with the Kansas Corporation Commission brought her into the world of regulatory law, and she eventually made her way to Southwestern Bell (now AT&T) in Topeka.\n\nLori\u2019s path took many different twists and turns in a variety of different locations, including Dallas, DC, San Antonio, Oklahoma City, and NYC, as she worked in a variety of different areas including business sales, external affairs, and global customer service. As she began work with the corporate communications and strategy units, unanswered questions surrounding the advent of big data, and its implications for privacy, started popping up more and more. She was AT&T\u2019s first Big Data attorney and later became Chief Privacy Officer, an integral part of the business world\u2019s initial development of strategies around big data and privacy on global scales. She now leads the AT&T Legal Department\u2019s Center of Expertise on Privacy and Security.\n\nLori\u2019s recent career at AT&T has been spent mastering data protection and consumer privacy, something that many of today\u2019s businesses are trying to get right. Some of her earliest, simplest learnings still apply: data protections and privacy won\u2019t be solved with a \u201ccheck-the-box\u201d approach right before deployment; it must be \u201cbaked in\u201d to any product or strategy.\n\nLori graduated from Western Illinois University and Washburn Law School (Go Ichabods!)."}

Prior to this, Bob was Senior Vice President of  Cognitive Applications, where he was responsible for infusing AI in all IBM applications. He also led IBM Developer Ecosystems and is focused on enabling the world\u2019s developers to access IBM tools at scale. He was appointed in 2016 by Chairman, President and CEO Ginni Rometty as the company\u2019s first Chief Digital Officer with a mission to change how IBM innovation is delivered and consumed by the world\u2019s leading organizations.\n\nBob has rebuilt IBM\u2019s digital platforms to make it easier for clients and partners to access and deploy IBM technologies, while strengthening ties with the VC-backed startup community to ensure a steady stream of new innovation. His focus on breaking down silos, agile ways of working and instilling a startup mentality in the 108 year-old company have transformed how IBM engages with clients.\n\nAt the center of this work is a commitment to the developers and data scientists of the open source community. Bob oversees IBM\u2019s leadership and participation in dozens of open source communities, contribution and donation of open source code, and overall industry advocacy.\n\nIn 2018 Bob launched Call for Code, a major initiative to give developers and data scientists ubiquitous access to IBM tools and technologies as a means to solve global, societal challenges. IBM has used technologies like Watson, blockchain and IoT to solve some of the most pressing issues in healthcare, financial services and government. Now in collaboration with the United Nations, the American Red Cross and the Clinton Foundation, IBM is helping the world\u2019s 23 million developers use those same technologies to address one of society\u2019s most pressing concerns: the growing human devastation caused by natural disasters. In the inaugural year of Call for Code, over one hundred thousand developers worked in teams to find immediate technological solutions to aid in disaster preparedness and relief, with the winning solution being rolled out in 2019.\n\nPrior to IBM, Bob served as President of AOL, leading the company through its evolution into a leading, global advertising platform. He also served as CEO of Razorfish, a pioneering digital transformation consultancy helping companies such as Ford, Pfizer, Conde Nast, Mercedes-Benz and Cisco redefine their brands for the digital age. He captured his experiences at Razorfish in the book he co-authored, Converge: Transforming Businesses at the Intersection of Marketing and Technology.\n\nBob\u2019s experience and passion have made him an active member of the TED community and a board member for Williams-Sonoma and Screenvision Media.\n\nHe started his career as an engineer, graduating from Syracuse University with a BS in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, before going on to graduate with an MBA from Harvard University.\n\nHe shares his passion for discovery with his wife and three children, and competitively participates in a number of outdoor activities and sports."}

The CIO organization operates in a highly centralized shared services model as IBM\u2019s single IT department, enabling IBM\u2019s transformation to an AI and cloud platform company \u2013 a cognitive enterprise.\n\nUnder his leadership, IBM pioneered new ways of delivering IT across the world\u2019s largest network, established an agile culture of breaking down big problems into small ones, and embedded design into operations (DesOps).\n\nFletcher was the first to identify opportunities that enabled IBM to offer a device choice program at the enterprise level, leading to consistently reduced IT support requests and record high customer satisfaction. This allows for new and creative ways to deliver support, including a number of Think Desks where IBMers can get personal service from experts. In October 2019, he announced IBM\u2019s plan to open source the \u201cchoice program\u201d code to help others transform how they enable IT for employees. His team also established a program to allow employees to purchase their workstation after a four-year period which resulted in a substantial reduction of tickets for damaged machines. And, with Watson AI technology, Fletcher\u2019s team is reducing the IT burden of managing its network of complex systems and over a half million devices.\n\nFletcher joined IBM in 2006 and has held several key roles in sales and technology. His extensive experience spans reinventing desktop computing environments (Windows, Mac, Linux), industry leading solutions for sellers and mobility programs, transforming IT infrastructure, delivering productivity tools and Agile transformation.\n\nPrior to joining IBM, he managed the Enterprise Systems Group at Walmart.com.\n\nFletcher holds Microsoft and Cisco certifications and is a graduate of Connecticut College with a degree in Political Science."}

After three years of operating, John was called upon to work on the ground breaking digital effects for The Abyss, a film that saw the first use of Photoshop, which he had co-developed with his brother, Thomas. Since that time, John has been promoted to Visual Effects Supervisor helming the visual effects on more than twenty feature films and commercials and most recently Chief Creative Officer of the studio. His film background coupled with an advanced understanding of digital technologies has made John a much sought-after supervisor having been honored with an Oscar and a BAFTA Award for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\u2019s Chest and six additional visual effects Academy Award nominations as well as five additional BAFTA nominations.\n\nJohn\u2019s supervisory credits also include the Star Wars Prequels, Episodes I, II,and III, Mission to Mars, Deep Blue Sea, Star Trek: First Contact, Mission: Impossible, Ghost Protocol and the Academy Award\u2122-winning Rango among others.

The film is based on a concept John created.\n\nJohn\u2019s interest in filmmaking began at an early age. Having a keen interest in visual effects, he was mesmerized by the original Star Wars film. During a visit to ILM in 1978 he was able to observe first-hand the world of visual effects. Inspired to learn more, John attended the USC School of Cinema and earned a Bachelor of Arts in Cinema Production, while freelancing as a modelmaker at a variety of Los Angeles-based production facilities.\n\nDuring his last year at USC, John took an advanced animation class where he built a motion control system from an Oxberry animation stand, an Apple II computer, a CNC milling machine controller, and a bunch of industrial surplus stepper motors. Impressed by the student film that was generated from this class project, ILM hired John as a Technical Assistant for motion control photography.\n\nGreatly impressed by visits to ILM\u2019s newly founded computer graphics department, John took up computer graphics as a hobby. Teaming up with his brother who was working on his Doctoral Thesis in computer vision at the University of Michigan, the Knoll brothers created Photoshop in 1987.\n\nJohn is a member of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences and currently serves on the Board of Governors representing the Visual Effects Branch."}

Her job is to oversee the production for all Netflix original films, particularly those in the U.S. \n\nMs Whitcher moved to Netflix as one of three big-name signings that were brought in to help the company ramp up its production both in the U.S. and internationally. At the same time, Netflix also brought in noted producers Momita SenGupta (VP of Physical Production for Original Series) and Steven Squillante (VP of Physical Production for International Originals) into similar positions. Netflix VP of Physical Production, Ty Warren, labelled the signing of the trio as a significant move in Netflix\u2019s ability to produce its own top-quality content. \n\nShortly after the signing coup in 2018, Netflix unveiled a new production hub in New Mexico. It purchased ABQ Studios and committed to $80 million a year in qualified spending from the Albuquerque base. In its first year, that spend was almost $150 million, much of which was on productions overseen by Ms Whitcher. \n\nMs Whitcher refers to her role as a hands-off one. While she is in charge of the production of films, including their budgets, she often has many films being produced at a given time. She is a believer in not micro-managing her productions, and entrusts individual directors and producers with the freedom to make decisions without her input.\n\nBefore moving to Netflix, Ms Whitcher had producing roles in more than 50 films over the space of 32 years. She is considered one of the top feature producers in Hollywood, and has worked with high profile directors such as Steven Spielberg, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Condon, Joss Whedon, Rob Marshall, and the Russo brothers, Anthony and Joseph. She started working in the film industry in 1986. \n\nMs Whitcher produced a number of films under the Marvel banner, having first been an executive producer on Kenneth Branagh\u2019s Thor in 2011. She also produced Joss Whedon\u2019s The Avengers, which broke box-office records when it was released in 2012. Ms Whitcher continued her work with Marvel on Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, Captain Marvel, and Spider-Man: Homecoming. Such was her standing within Marvel, that a character, Agent Whitcher, was named in her honour in Captain Marvel.\n\nMs Whitcher has had producing roles on Oscar-winning films Dreamgirls and Memoirs of a Geisha. She has credits on a number of acclaimed productions such as The Soloist, The Terminal, Godzilla, My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding, and Unconditional Love.\n\nMs Whitcher has lived her whole life in Los Angeles. She was educated at Loyola Marymount University, and has two children. She is commonly known as Patty. \n"}

Edgar!\" featuring John Goodman, Kelsey Grammer, and Christopher Guest.\n\nShortly after, Levin co-founded Captured Live Productions, where he produced the AdLib Comedy Series for Sony Entertainment, co-partnered with Sprint to launch the first ever 24-hour mobile comedy network and was brought on to produce X's, critically acclaimed 25th anniversary special, X: Live in Los Angeles. Levin directed multiple television specials while at Captured Live, including Pretty, Funny Women for WeTV, (Chelsea Handler); William Shatner's Has Been Live, (William Shatner/Ben Folds/Henry Rollins); Particle: Transformations Live, (Joe Satriani/Blackalicious/Robby Krieger); and interviews with Ann and Nancy Wilson for Heart: Dreamboat Annie Live.\n\nLevin has produced and directed multiple television specials for multi-platinum recording artist, Yanni, including PBS's Yanni: Voices, Voices Live in Acapulco and A Living Legacy, the latter of which was the first television special produced under the Levin Productions banner. Live at El Morro, filmed with 22 cameras at Puerto Rico's historic 16th century fortress, debuted on PBS in Spring 2012. Levin worked with Disney/Hollywood Records recording artist, Nathan Pacheco, on his debut PBS special before re-joining Yanni on his 2013 world tour throughout Europe and Asia.\n\nLevin was hired in late 2013 to help launch BiteSizeTV, where he co-created Hollywood Today Live for FOX Television and served as an Executive Producer on the show's initial 6-week run, ushering it to a full-year pickup. Levin also directed several specials in conjunction with Dave Stewart's Weapons of Mass Entertainment featuring live performances and interviews with Ringo Starr, Billy Ray Cyrus, Drake Bell and many others.\n\nIn 2014, Levin joined Harpo Productions for Oprah: Where are They Now on the OWN Network, conducting in-depth celebrity interviews with guests including Leah Remini, Leeza Gibbons, Master P and Lisa Rinna-- the latter of which earned him a guest appearance on Bravo's Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Also in 2014, Levin released his 5th collaboration with Yanni and PBS, World Without Borders, which continues to enjoy worldwide success.\n\nOn January 1, 2015, The Oprah Winfrey Network aired an all-day series of civil rights specials, for which Levin's work was nominated for an NAACP Image Award. Later that year, Levin collaborated with Yanni again for a massive production at the Great Pyramids of Giza in Cairo, Egypt, which will air on PBS stations throughout 2016. Levin also produced season 6 of Oprah: Where Are They Now, returning to OWN fall, 2016.\n"}

His role is to act as Netflix\u2019s leading lobbyist around the world, working with local producers and governments, creating ratings systems for content and negotiating government intervention on production. \n\nAs VP of Public Policy, Mr Garfield provides public policy expertise, defining and achieving strategic objectives, and satisfying an increasing desire for Netflix to create positive social impact. He has a background in legal and tactical decision-making, as well as two decades in leadership positions. \n\nMr Garfield lives and works in Amsterdam, and is reportedly the first VP of Public Policy to be based outside the U.S. His offshore base is part of Netflix\u2019s efforts to focus its public policy strategy abroad - particularly in Europe - where greater growth opportunities exist and regulators can be more combative. \n\nBefore joining Netflix in 2019, Mr Garfield was President and CEO for the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) for 10 years. The ITI is a global advocacy body representing some of the world\u2019s leading tech companies. His role was to work between member organizations and global law- and decision-makers to develop policies in areas including sustainable technology, the growing global marketplace, diversity, and cybersecurity. Under his leadership, the ITI nearly doubled its membership and became known as world-leading advocates for the technology sector, representing companies such as Apple, Amazon, Google, Ebay, and Facebook. Such was his role in advocating technology causes and initiatives, that Mr Garfield was referred to as the face and voice of the tech sector.\n\nMr Garfield worked as Executive Vice President and Chief Strategic Officer for the Motion Picture Association from 2004-2009, developing global strategies, forging industry alliances, and leading key operational objectives and the research and development department.\n\nFrom 2000-2004, Mr Garfield was Vice President of Legal Affairs at the Recording Industry Association of America. He led the organization\u2019s intellectual property policy, a role which saw him feature in high profile legal battles such as the Grokster/Kazaa Supreme Court case that proved influential in the provision of music streaming services both in the U.S. and abroad. He started his career as a litigation lawyer with a passion for Pro Bono cases, and in 1999 successfully argued for clemency for Calvin Swann, who was facing the death penalty for murder.\n\nMr Garfield served on President Obama\u2019s Trade Advisory Council and the Department of Transportation Advisory Committee on Automation. He has also served on the board of directors for CFES Brilliant Pathways, College for Every Student, the SEED School of Washington, D.C., and was the Board President of Aiden Montessori School. \n\nIn 2015 Mr Garfield was named by The Hill as a top lobbyist, and in 2010 he received the REACH Breaking Barriers award for his work in helping the tech sector to support and inspire young people to develop skills and knowledge in science, technology, engineering, and math. \n\nMr Garfield has a law degree from New York University and a master\u2019s degree in international affairs and public administration from Princeton University. He was born in Jamaica, and is a naturalized US citizen.\n"}

My areas of responsibility at the company include Business Operations, Research, Business Analytics, Finance, Support, Legal, and Investor Relations. \n\nI found my way to The Org because I believe we can build better teams, communities, and companies through transparency. To me, one of the most rewarding experiences in life is when I feel deeply connected to the people I spend the most time with, and I have strong conviction that we can achieve this by seeing the world clearly and by letting the world see into us. \n\nIn this day and age, we spend the vast majority of our waking hours with colleagues. While I understand the fear of transparency in a professional setting, I have experienced first hand the power of openness and vulnerability which lead to better relationships, stronger teams, higher performance and sustained happiness. \n\nPlease feel free to reach out (lucy@theorg.com) if you want to chat about anything! In the meantime, here are a few things about who I am, what I believe in, and my work style.\n\n--\n\nWhat\u2019s my definition of success:\nI feel successful at the end of a day if at least one of the following is true:\n     1. Did I make a real, positive change in someone\u2019s life today, however small?\n     2. Did I actively work on being a better version of myself today vs. yesterday?\n     3. Did I empower those around me to feel they are capable of achieving more?\n\nMy communication style:\nI\u2019m a terrible liar so I really can\u2019t hide anything even if I tried. I love it when I can have a face to face conversation that is direct, honest, and open. I aim to always communicate from a place of understanding instead of a desire to change people\u2019s mind. I appreciate a communication style that is succinct, thoughtful, and respectful. Additionally, I\u2019m big on data and facts, so I especially appreciate when people come in with supporting evidence, numbers, and sources to back up their claim. \n\nQualities I value:\nTenacity, compassion, loyalty, self-motivation, thoughtfulness, honesty, and openness.\n\nPet peeves:\nSelfishness, inauthenticity, and arrogance.\n\nWhat do people misunderstand about me:\nI may come off as quite direct and even intense sometimes, but it really stems from a place of honesty and eagerness to have transparent and open dialog without needing to beat around the bush. I push myself and my team hard to outperform, but I by no means believe that performance is the ultimate goal to chase after. One of the things I care the most about is to be the best manager and teammate I can be, and I see my ability to motivate others as the primary way to add value. However, I understand that\u2019s not always what people need, so I adjust my style accordingly to support others in different ways. Adapting my style to fit what others need is something I\u2019m constantly working on.\n\nFun fact about me:\nYou can find me selling honey at the local farmers market on Saturdays when the weather is nice, and selling Christmas trees on a street corner every December."}
